VRLabs' Instancing system that copies files over for use in the Assets directory and can also runs install scripts

### ⬇️ [Download Latest Version](https://github.com/VRLabs/Instancer/releases/latest)


---

## How it works

* It gets called by a small dummy file included in the package, and when called copies all the files over, and replaces references to old files with references to new files.
* It can also run an install script callback once it's done with this.

## Install guide

* It should generally only be installed as a dependency of a VRLabs package

## How to use

* Click the `VRLabs/[PackageName]` button in the toolbar and select an output folder to copy to.
